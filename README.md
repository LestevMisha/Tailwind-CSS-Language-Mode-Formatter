# Tailwind CSS Language Mode Formatter VS Code Extension

**Tailwind CSS Language Mode Formatter** is a Visual Studio Code extension that enables you to format files with `.css` extention if the language mode of this extention is set to `Tailwind CSS`.

> Extension was made when custom css has to be added in stylesheet (since there is no Tailwind CSS formatter by default).

To use the extention, open the Command Palette and type `>/tailwind Format File`, or press the shortcut `Alt` + `Shift` + `F`.

Ensure you are using the Tailwind CSS Language Mode, check the screenshot below.
